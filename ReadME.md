Using the theory behind the truth table , we can find all the possible variations of Resistors in parellel.You just need to type :
  - Number of avilable resistors (number of factors of the truth table)
  - Values of the avilable resistors

and then the code will automatically generate a txt file with all the possible resistors values and the combination needed in parellel.
